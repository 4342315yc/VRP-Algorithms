# Cluster-First, Route-Second Algorithms

* Fisher and Jakimar

This algorithm refers to solve a *GA(generalized assignment)* problem.

* The Sweep Algorithm

Imagine a ray centered at the depot. By rotating the ray, the customers can be divided into multiple clusters. By performing a TSP algorithm on each cluster we can form a solution in the end.


* The Petal Algorithm
