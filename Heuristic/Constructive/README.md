## Clarke and Wright savings algorithm
In this algorithm, *saving* is defined to be the distance saved by merging two seperate routes, i.e. ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?{s_{ij}=c_{i0}&plus;c_{0j}-c_{ij}}), where ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?c_{i0},&space;c_{0j},&space;c_{ij}) is defined as the distance between the depot with customer *i*, as the distance between the depot with customer *j*, and as the distance between customer *i* and customer *j*.
