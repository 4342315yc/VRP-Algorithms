# Cluster-First, Route-Second Algorithms

* Fisher and Jakimar

This algorithm refers to solve a *GA(generalized assignment)* problem.

* The Sweep Algorithm

Imagine a ray centered at the depot. By rotating the ray, the customers can be divided into multiple clusters. By performing a TSP algorithm on each cluster we can form a solution in the end.

The following is two pictures taken from page 68 of the [slides](http://www.discovery.dist.unige.it/didattica/LS/VRP.pdf) by **Massimo Paolucci**.
